# hello-world
My first depository

Hello world, my name is Eric. I live in Sweden and I am getting into git-hub via an online data-science course. I am looking forward to a rewarding experience and I am excited about the possibilites. I'm most interested in GIS systems and image processing (mostly for satellite data), but I would also like to learn about data collection of the physical environment and the internet of things.
